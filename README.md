## KPMG 

It’s my pleasure to share my experience as a virtual intern at KMPG for the year 2022. The journey has been interesting and impactful. At the KPMG virtual internship, we were saddled with the responsibility of conducting a thorough assessment of the data, cleaning the data, and using the cleaned data for analysis which was used to come up with a substantial recommendation for the shareholders of the  Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, to identify which of the 1000 customers Sprocket Central Pty Ltd the company should target, based on the dataset given.
Working on the Sprocket Central Pty Ltd data which is a medium size bike & cycling accessories organization, in Australia, and the shareholders through the marketing team are looking to boost business by analyzing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behavior with the given datasets:
1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3.  Transaction data in the past three months.

## Process (Task 2)

Using  Python, Tableau, and PowerPoint for the analysis, visualization, and report presentation for the shareholders. 
Using Python to test data quality by checking for missing, duplicated, and outliers data. Then going on to clean the data by removing duplicates, missing rows, and outliers  (as they might skew the analysis). Also streamlining the data into the desired Dataframe of all the variables that are relevant to the selection of the target customers. 

## Model used

The model used was the RFM analysis model which is a data-driven customer behavior segmentation technique where RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. (The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was(Recency), how often they’ve purchased in the past(Frequency), and how much they spent(Monetary). All three of these measures have proven to be effective predictors of a customer’s willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers.)

## Recomendations

Using the analysis, recommendations were made advising the shareholders on which 1000 customers the company should target. The recommended high-value 1000 customers are:
1. Customers within the age of 40-50
2. Female customers
3. Customers working in Financial Service, Manufacturing, and Health
4. Customers living in New South Wales and Victoria.

## Report (Task 3)

The report for the shareholders was made with PowerPoint and a Tableau dashboard detailing the required focus for the company.
I want to thank God for the grace and the push to keep developing my skills since I began my data science journey, I also want to thank Bukunmi Ajayi for constantly sharing great opportunities with me.
